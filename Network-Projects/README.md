# Wireshark Investigations
## Carried out for hands-on experience and to deepen my understanding of networks and their attack vectors

Analyzed a malicious PCAP where a phishing email led to a malvertising site that delivered a Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). Tracked the infection chain, decoded obfuscated scripts, and identified IOCs using tools like CyberChef and VirusTotal. Gained hands-on experience with Wireshark, threat hunting, and Blue Team techniques.

This follow-up Wireshark project dives into another real-world malware PCAP, this time focusing on a file downloaded from a fake software site. Itâ€™s part of my ongoing series exploring malicious traffic and network behavior. These projects reflect my commitment to building practical skills with industry tools like Wireshark, while strengthening my understanding of networking and threat analysis.
