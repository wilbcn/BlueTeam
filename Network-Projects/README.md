# Wireshark Investigations
## Carried out for hands-on experience and to deepen my understanding of networks and their attack vectors

Analyzed a malicious PCAP where a phishing email led to a malvertising site that delivered a Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). Tracked the infection chain, decoded obfuscated scripts, and identified IOCs using tools like CyberChef and VirusTotal. Gained hands-on experience with Wireshark, threat hunting, and Blue Team techniques.
