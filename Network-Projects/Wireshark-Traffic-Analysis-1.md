 ðŸ“¡ Wireshark Project 1: Traffic Analysis & Scan Detection

This project is part of my Blue Team learning journey. It focuses on using **Wireshark** to investigate real network traffic, understand protocol behaviors, and detect network scans like those performed by tools such as **Nmap**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Learn to navigate and use Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Understand core protocols: ARP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP, TCP
- Practice writing display filters to isolate traffic patterns
- Practice using Wiresharks UI
- Identify common scan types: TCP Connect, SYN, UDP
- Use Wireshark statistics, conversation views, and stream following

## Tools & Resources
- [PCAP Analysed](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/06/24/index.html)

## ðŸ“– Project Walkthrough: Analyzing a Real-World PCAP in Wireshark
This section showcases the steps and thought process behind my decisions to carry out this project. 

### 1. Getting the sample PCAP file. Initial file analysis.
To kick off this project, I booted up my secure AWS-based Homelab EC2 instance. I then downloaded a real-world packet capture file from [Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/06/24/index.html), which is also noted in the **Tools & Resources** section.

Once the `.pcap` file was extracted using the password `infected<date>`, I loaded it into Wireshark for investigation.

- Successfully loaded PCAP file into Wireshark

### 1.1 Investigating Capture File Properties
The first step after loading the capture was to review its basic properties via **Statistics â†’ Capture File Properties**. This pane provides essential metadata that helps establish a baseline understanding of the capture. Key findings included:
- Number of packets captured: 1633
- SHA1 Hash: 1c8f8d8fc4fa0872de90c126e9187884b54812ae
- SHA256 Hash: 55627f6b1cfa892b52eb0884fdd4545837c23d72a73b6d2ebb951bd7c41cbe46

These hashes are useful for ensuring integrity if the file is shared or submitted as evidence. Additionally, this section gives you details on the time span of the capture, data link type, and whether any packets were dropped, which can all affect analysis quality.

### 1.2 Investigating Protocol Hierarchy
Next, I analyed how many packets were associated with key protocols via **Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy**. This step helps build a profile of the network activity observed. Key findings include:
- TCP Packets: 1631
- HTTP Packets: 10
- SMTP Packets: 55
- IMF Packets: 4
- DNS Packets: 2
- Data packets: 19
- Media type packets: 2
- IPv4 Packets: 100% (no IPv6 packets)

### 1.3 Investigating Resolved Addresses
Next, I enabled **Name Resolution** for addresses, and then **Statistics -> Resolved Addresses**. This may allow us to spot suspicious or unusual domains from an instant glance. In our example PCAP, we already are beginning to see some red flags, given the domain `makemoneyeasywith.me`. This is definately worth investigating in later steps of this project and investigation.

### 1.4 Investigating Conversations
Next, I navigated to **Statistics -> Conversations**. This view allows us to identify which IP addresses our host is communicating with the most â€” both in terms of volume and direction of traffic. An initial analysis shows that majority of the traffic has 0 bytes and packets returned. However, by filtering by packets returned to the host `Packets B -> A`, we are able to identify several addresses that did return traffic, and are worth investigating further.

- Sender IP (the local machine): `10.6.24.101`

<img width="1430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a9bda8a-8ffe-4998-a2dc-b7bb38245642" />

This filtered view helps us zero in on meaningful traffic rather than sifting through every outbound connection manually. In a later segment, I will be investigating further these identified destination IP addresses.

### 1.5 Investigating Endpoints
After analysing the **Conversations** view (which shows IP pairs communicating), I moved on to **Statistics â†’ Endpoints**, which focuses on **individual IP addresses**. By filtering with `packets`, the same addresses are appearing as suspicious. 

`188.225.26.48`
- Most active external IP in this capture. 1028 packets
- High volume communication. 948kB
- Sent 669 Packets to the host
- Delivered most of the data in this payload. 924kB
- Received 359 packets from the host
- Received 24kB back from the host

Verdict: Highly suspicious! Sent nearly 1MB of data to our internal host.

`195.154.255.65`
- Smaller number of connections overall
- Much less traffic than the first IP address
- Sent 20 packets to our local machine
- Delivered a large single response or perhaps a secondary payload, 24kB.
- Host sent 13 packets to this IP address

Verdict: Appears to be a one time connection, possibly a fairly large download. Definately worth investigating further.
