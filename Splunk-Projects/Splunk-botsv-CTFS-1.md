# üñ•Ô∏è Splunk Investigations: Analysing the BOTSv3 dataset to answer CTFs

## üìñ Overview  
Since configuring my Splunk Enterprise server on AWS and my initial analysis of the attack dataset, I was kindly provided with the dataset ctf questions and answers. This project documents my thought process on how I was able to answer the outlined questions. This document serves more of a learning resource for myself, but equally showcases my on going dedication improving my analytical skills and investigation skills using Splunk.

Setup of this Splunk Server can be found here [Setup](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/blob/main/Splunk-Projects/Splunk-Enterprise-HomeLab.md)
A pre-investigation without access to the CTF q/a's can be found here [Link](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/blob/main/Splunk-Projects/Splunk-botsv3-Investigation-1.md)

This document covers the first 20 questions of the BOTSv3 dataset. Below I have outlined each question individually, and any steps or thought processes taken in order to successfully locate the answer.

## üéØ Goals
- Answer a wide variety of CTF question and answers from the BOTSv3 attack dataset
- Logically carry out investigations using Splunk and analyse the returned events
- Prepare myself for the BTL1 exam !

### Question 1: List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly's AWS environment?
To answer this question, I ran an initial query focusing on AWS cloud trail, which covers API calls made from AWS users.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail"
```

- From here, I spotted interesting field: `user`, which I honed in on.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" | dedup user | table user
```

- By looking back at the original question, here we are looking at AWS IAM Users, not services or anything else. This way, we can pick out the answers quite easily.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" IAM eventSource="iam.amazonaws.com"
```

- By adding the event source to our search, we confirm the IAM users.

**Answers**: `bstoll, btun, splunk_access, web_admin`

### Question 2: What field would you use to alert that AWS API activity have occurred without MFA (multi-factor authentication)?
This question still revolves around API calls, so I will stick to focusing on the previous source type for cloud trail.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail"
```

- After running this query, I browsed through the list of interesting fields, and could not initially see anything related to MFA. I noticed we had 348 more fields (extra interesting fields) that can add and filter through to aid our search. Here I searched for `multi` and `mfa` and came accross:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee79e0f9-454b-4d5f-bd3a-b83b98cee900)

**Answer**: `userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated`

### Question 3: What is the processor number used on the web servers?
I was a bit stuck on this one. I initially searched through http events for web traffic,  hoping this might be in the metadata somewhere. Going back to the BOTSv3 documentation on source types, I noticed we have `hardware`.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="hardware"
```

**Answer**: `E5-2676`

### Question 4: Bud accidentally makes an S3 bucket publicly accessible. What is the event ID of the API call that enabled public access?
More API related questions. I can again focus on cloud trail as a basic. 

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail"
```

- From here, I filtered down on `interesting fields`, choosing `eventSource - s3.amazonaws.com`.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com"
```

- By looking at `eventName`, I get an initial understanding on the API calls made in relation to S3 buckets.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a6fa9fd-c826-4ff0-a69d-b0a3247a8a5a)

- I then ran an updated SPL query to take a closer look at this.

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com" | dedup eventName | table eventName
```

- Out of the 15 events, one stood out initially. In AWS - PUT operations modify or set configurations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14711345-e8c6-497c-bc8e-4fc3fccdda2c)

- I then referred to the official AWS documentation on this API call to confirm my suspicions. [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAcl.html)
- Back to the question, we need to find the eventID of this API call. 

```
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com"  eventName=PutBucketAcl
```

- We now just have 2 events to investigate to find out answer.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03b22cd-1893-44a2-b876-86a89f4e21d9)

- By examining the raw text of these two events, we find the uri `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers` and permission `FULL_CONTROL`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d70cee-5552-4e2d-8135-5d888ec220d0)

- The `eventID` within this event data gives us the answer.

**Answer**: ab45689d-69cd-41e7-8705-5350402cf7ac

### Question 5: What is the name of the S3 bucket that was made publicly accessible?
We already had the answer to this from the previous question. In the raw data we have:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5812cbd-3e71-445e-aeaf-30bd6b52db1a)

**Answer**: `frothlywebcode`

### Question 6: What is the name of the text file that was successfully uploaded into the S3 bucket while it was publicly accessible?
