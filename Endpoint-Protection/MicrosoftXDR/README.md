# Endpoint security with Microsoft XDR

Projects found in this folder showcase exploring the Microsoft XDR platform, where I carry out fundamental projects to help solidy existing knowledge and gain further experience using the XDR UI. I explore various areas of XDR, including Security, Purview, Entra, Email & Collaboration, and more.

## Data-Loss-Prevention-Practice
In this beginner project, I get familiar with Microsoft Purview and Data Loss Prevention capabilities (DLP). I created 3 policies for the organisation, including:
- PII Detection & External Sharing Block: Detect and restrict external sharing of PII such as passport numbers
- Keyword Leakage: Prevent files with sensitive business tags from being shared externally (e.g, "Confidential", "Internal Use Only")
- File type-based policy: Detect and block specific file types from being shared externally (e.g., .zip, .exe)

## Email & Collaboration THreat Protection
