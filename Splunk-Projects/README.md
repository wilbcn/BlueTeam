# Splunk
Splunk projects where I carry out scenario-based security investigations on my Splunk Cloud Home Lab setup. My aim in each project is to not only gain hands-on experience with Splunk, but integration with the MITRE ATTACK framework.

## Splunk-Cloud-HomeLab.md
This documentation outlines the process of configuring Splunk Cloud to receive and analyze log data from both Windows and Linux instances using Universal Forwarders (UF). The goal of this project is to develop hands-on experience with log aggregation, security monitoring, and Splunk Processing Language (SPL) within my HomeLab setup.

## Splunk-Investigations-1.md
This project expands upon my Splunk Cloud setup with Universal Forwarders by focusing on a specific security scenario: securing /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd from unauthorized access attempts. The goal is to detect, alert, and mitigate potential threats using Splunk SPL searches, alerts, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

By structuring our detection and response techniques around MITRE's T1003.008 (OS Credential Dumping), I ensure alignment with real-world security methodologies. This project also serves as a learning resource for developing Blue Team skills, including log analysis, alerting, and security monitoring.

## Splunk-Investigations-2.md
This project is a continuation of my Splunk series, aimed at gaining hands-on experience with the Splunk platform and learning how to use the Splunk Processing Language (SPL) effectively to investigate and report on security events. In this follow-up, I explore and continue learning key Splunk features such as alerts and dashboards, while aligning all detection and mitigation strategies with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to mirror real-world security operations. This projects focuses on unauthorised administrator account creation and privilege escalation on a Windows machine â€” a critical persistence tactic used by adversaries (MITRE Technique: T1098 - Account Manipulation).
