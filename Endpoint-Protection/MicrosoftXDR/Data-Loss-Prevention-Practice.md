# üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft XDR: Hands-on practice with Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

## üìò Overview
This project showcases my practical learning and hands-on experience with **Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** policies as part of my Microsoft XDR studies. Using a Microsoft 365 E5 trial and lab simulation, I created, tested, and documented several DLP policies designed to protect sensitive data from accidental or malicious exposure.

This project also serves as a learning resource for myself, helping to solidify my knowledge on this security tool.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Understand the core components and capabilities of Microsoft DLP.
- Create and apply DLP policies in Microsoft Purview for different use cases.
- Simulate policy matches using test content and observe policy behavior.
- Gain hands-on experience aligning DLP with regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI).

## DLP Summary
Data loss prevention (DLP) is a cybersecurity strategy designed to prevent unauthorised access, usage, and transmission of sensitive data. It involves monitoring data at rest, in motion, and in use, to help prevent potential data breaches. DLP is implemented to protect confidential information and comply with industry regulatory compliances such as GDPR and HIPAA.
