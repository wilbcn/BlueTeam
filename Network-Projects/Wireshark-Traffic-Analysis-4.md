# ðŸ“¡ Wireshark Project 4: 

## Overview
Another Wireshark hands-on lab, investigating a malware pcap called "Big Fish in a Little Pong". This investigation was carried out on my own virtual homelab, created on VirtualBox, with a Kali linux distro. 

## Goals
- Executive Summary: State in simple terms what happened (who, what, when)
- Victim Details: Correlate and share the details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name etc)
- Indentify the IOC's: IP addresses, domains, and urls, associated with the attacker activity. Hashes of any malware from the pcap.
- Apply a logical analysis to the PCAP, leveraring the knowledge I have gained from independant study (Blue Team Level 1), and TryHackMe CTF style Labs.
- Prepare myself for the BTL1 exam, and gain experience with report writing during investigations.

## Investigation
### 1. PCAP Overview
Pre-investigation, I performed an initial overview of the PCAP, identifying bits of information which will assist in the overall investigation of the malware PCAP.

#### Key Info
- **PCAP SHA256 Hash**: `8fee06d0b1686faab4364f5b7a741e736ad7e713d5ca9299ff9161a4b4d4862e`
- **First Packet**: `2024-09-04 18:32:31`
- **Last Packet**: `2024-09-04 19:32:07`
- **Total Packets**: `5091`

- **Protocol Hierarchy**

#### Key Info
- **Majority of packets are IPv4 traffic**: `94.2%`
- **A large amount of traffic is sent with TLS encrpytion**: `82.9%` - Could hide C2 and data exfiltration.
- **HTTP Traffic**: `2.2%` `114 packets` - HTTP web traffic is unencrypted, could reveal URLS or malicious payloads.
- **Kerberos, DHCP, NetBios**: Useful for who logged in, which devices were given IPs, and hostname information.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: `3.4%` `173 packets` - Check for DNS Tunnelling (Attackers hiding extra data inside DNS queries)
- **Address Resolution Protocol**: `5.8%` `294 packets` - Check for ARP Poisoning / MITM attacks. 

- **Capture File Properties**

#### Key Info
- **Victims endpoint**: `DESKTOP-RNVO9AT.bepositive.com (172.17.0.99)`
- **Address with most packets**: `win-ctl9xbq9y19.bepositive.com (172.17.0.17)` - 321kB total - 1308 packets (699 Aâ†’B, 609 Bâ†’A) 
- **Top Data Receiver**: `ns170.seeoux.com (46.254.34.201)` â†’ 782 packets, 720 kB total, more inbound data ((278 Aâ†’B, 504 Bâ†’A))
- **Unresolved IP**: `79.124.78.197` - 591 packets - 64kB total
- **Cloud/C2 Services Contacted**: Multiple `*.azure.com`, `cloudapp.azure.com`, `akamai`, `trafficmanager.net`

### 2. Investigating HTTP and DNS Traffic (Application-Layer)
To begin the investigation, I began looking at http traffic. By searching `http`, and then checking **Statisticsâ†’Endpoints** to see which IPs were most involved with http:

- `DESKTOP-RNVO9AT.bepositive.com1`
- `79.124.78.197`

- I then ran a new filter to investigate further the identified addresses.
