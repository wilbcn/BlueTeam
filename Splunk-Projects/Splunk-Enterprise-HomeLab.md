# üñ•Ô∏è Splunk Enterprise: Manual Data Ingestion & Lab Setup for Security Analysis

## üìñ Overview
This documentation outlines the setup and configuration of a Splunk Enterprise standalone instance for manual data ingestion and security analysis.  
The objective of this project is to build a longer-term hands-on environment for learning SPL (Search Processing Language), performing threat hunting, and preparing for the BTL1 certification.  
Log sources include **BOTSv1**, **Suricata**, and **Sysmon** datasets.

## üéØ Goals
- **Deploy and configure Splunk Enterprise** on a standalone server (EC2 instance).  
- **Manually ingest datasets** such as BOTSv1, Suricata logs, and Sysmon logs.  
- **Develop scenario-based investigations** to simulate security incidents.  
- **Integrate analysis with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for adversary behavior mapping.

### Learning & Practical Applications
- Building a **medium-term Splunk lab** suitable for threat detection and log analysis.
- Mastering **manual data ingestion techniques** into custom indexes.
- Developing **SPL search queries** for security investigation.
