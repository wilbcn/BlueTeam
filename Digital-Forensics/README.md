# Digital Forensics Projects
Projects carried out for digital forensics. Includes phishing email analysis, and projects leveraging a wide variety of forensic tools. 

## Investigating-Deleted-Files.md
This project demonstrates a forensic investigation into deleted files within a Windows virtual machine (VM). The objective is to recover files that were moved to the Recycle Bin, analyze them for potential threats, and determine whether they indicate malicious intent. We leverage **RBCmd.exe**, a Windows forensic tool, to extract and restore deleted files. Additionally, we utilize metadata analysis, hashing, and threat intelligence tools such as **ExifTool**, **CSVQuickViewer**, and **VirusTotal** to conduct a comprehensive investigation.

## Investigating-WebBrowsers.md
This document details the steps taken to gain hands-on experience with **Windows Browser History Capturer/Viewer** as part of a digital forensics investigation. In this project, we simulated a scenario where a test user, Tom Smith, engaged in web browsing activities using Microsoft Edge. As the system administrator, we conducted an analysis of their browsing history, capturing and examining the data using forensic tools to identify any suspicious activity.
This project was inspired by my learning in the **Blue Team Level 1** course, reinforcing key digital forensics concepts in a controlled environment. By applying real-world investigative techniques within a secure VM, I am able to deepen my understanding of forensic methodologies while gaining practical experience with industry-standard tools and software.
