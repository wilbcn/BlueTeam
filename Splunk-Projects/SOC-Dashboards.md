# ðŸ”Ž Splunk Dashboards: Creating SOC-style Splunk dashboards

## ðŸ“– Overview
I have been learning Splunk for a while now, creating and deploying EC2 instances to configure Splunk Universal Forwarders, and investigating BOTS (Battle Of The SOC) datasets CTF style learning. In this project, I aim to continue to work this these attack datasets, however this time focusing on creating dashboards, that would be relevant and used in a SOC environment. In this project, I create dashboards for the following security events:

- Insert
- Insert
- Insert

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

### Pre-project Planning
Before starting this project, I ran the below SPL query to get a better understanding of the sourcetypes within the data. That way I can logically pick sourcetypes that contain event data, for meaningful dashboards.

```
index=* | stats count by sourcetype | sort -count
```

Sourcetypes to focus on:
- `aws:cloudtrail`: Cloud Attack Surface
- `osquery:results`: Track suspicious processes
- `stream:dns + stream:http`: Network Threat Detection
