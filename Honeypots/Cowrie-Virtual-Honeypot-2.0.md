# Cowrie-Based Honeypot Deployment on AWS 2.0

## ðŸ“š Overview
This follow up project is an adaptation and refinement of my original Cowrie honeypot deployment, found here: [link](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/edit/main/Honeypots/Cowrie-Virtual-Honeypot.md). This project serves as both a trial phase towards my research project proposal on honeypot realism and fingerprinting (University project), as well as a continuation of hands-on experience that covers multiple security domains like OS hardening and network security.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Deploy a secure SSH honeypot in AWS (secure admin access)
- Simulate a vulnerable SSH service to attract real-world attacks
- Log attacker behavior and extract useful insights
- Configure the EC2 instance with the `CIS Hardened Image Level 1 on Ubuntu Linux Server 24.04 LTS`
- Allow brute force attempts after a defined number - Edit the config file
- Lay the foundation for the next trial phase, of Splunk integration for log aggregation and analysis

## ðŸ“¦ 1 â€“ Cloud Setup
In this follow up project, I create a brand new ec2 instance with similar configurations as the original deployment. This time, leveraging the hardened AMI from AWS marketplace. I also deployed the instance with instance type `t3.medium`, as this is currently what I intend to use during my research project implementation.

### 1.1 - Honeypot Overview
Once inside my AWS account, I navigated to EC2 and selected launch instance. I named it `Cowrie-Trial-01`, and went to `Browse more AMIs`.

From here, I selected the appropriate AMI, and `subscribe on instance launch`.

With the AMI successfully selected, I then chose our instance type `t3.medium`. I aim to deploy two contrasting honeypots for a comparative analysis, and therefore predict that this instance type will be a cost effective yet appropriate solution for my project.

I then created a new key pair for secure admin access. We use SSH keys to access the system securely, while cowrie as a honeypot simulates password logins for the attacker. Attackers interact with Cowries fake shell, not the real system.
