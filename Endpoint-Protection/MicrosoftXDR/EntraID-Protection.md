# üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft XDR: EntraID Policies

## üìò Overview
In this hands-on and practical project, I look at Identity Protection policies in Entra ID. This is a follow up project, where I previously explored Email & Collaboration policies to better secure email communications. [project](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/blob/main/Endpoint-Protection/MicrosoftXDR/Email-Collaboration-Threat-Protection.md). In this project I create a variety of policies related to user risks, user sign-ins, baseline conditional user access, and more. These projects in XDR serve as a learning resource for myself, whilst also demonstrating my on-going learning into industry standard cybersecurity tools. 

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Understand the role of Entra in detecting identity-based threats
- Configure and test risk-based conditional access policies
- Investigate risk detections and policy enforcement
- Carry out basic tests and analyse results/alerts in XDR.

## Microsoft Entra Summary
Microsoft Entra ID Protection is a cloud-based security feature within Microsoft Entra ID. It enables employees to securely access both external resources, such as Microsoft 365 and the Microsoft Azure portal, and internal applications. Entra ID protection specifically focuses on identifying, analysing, and mitigating identity-related risks in real time. By leverading advanced machine learning and AI, behaviour anomalies can be detected and conditional access policies enforced to assist in preventing unauthorised access. Entra ID acts as a first line of defence against identity-based threats, ensuring that only legitimate users are able to gain access to their intended resources. 

The core capabilities of Entra ID Protection are:
- **Sign-in Risk Detections**
-
