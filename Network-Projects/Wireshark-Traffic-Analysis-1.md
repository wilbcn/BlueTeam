# üì° Wireshark Investigation 1: First Malware PCAP Analysis!

This project is part of my on going Wireshark series, where I gain hands-on experience investigating real-world malware PCAPs using industry standard network analysis tools. Each project serves as an opportunity to sharpen my practical skills in dissecting malicious traffic, constructing a detailed timeline of events, and an executive summary to simulate the type of reporting expected from a SOC analyst.

## üéØ Objectives

- Practice navigating and using Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Investigate the malware pcap to collect the key indicators of compromise
- Construct a timeline of events
- Write an executive summary
- Leverage malware analysis and sandbox tools

## üìñ Project Walkthrough: Analysing a Real-World PCAP in Wireshark
### 1. Baseline file analysis.
To start any PCAP investigation, I always go through the **statistics** tabs of Wireshark. Here we can find key details regarding the most active addresses and most used protocols.

#### Capture File Properties
- **First Packet**: `2019-06-24 17:14:10`
- **Last Packet**: `2019-06-24 17:16:51`
- **PCAP SHA256 Hash**: `55627f6b1cfa892b52eb0884fdd4545837c23d72a73b6d2ebb951bd7c41cbe46`
- **Total Packets**: `1633`

#### Protocol Hierarchy

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ceeff26-528d-4cab-9c14-581b47158459)

- 100% of packets were IPv4
- 99.9% of packets were sent via TCP
- 55 packets for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - Port 25)
- Small amount of HTTP traffic, 10 packets

#### Conversations

- With name resolution toggled on

- `10.6.24.101`: must be our infected host
- `1158715-cy17485.tw1.ru` `188.255.26.48`: IP address with the most packets (1028) and data sent (948kB). Inheritently suspicious russian domain.
- `makemoneyeasywith.me` `185.254.190.200`: Suspicious domain name, 8 packets.
- There are multiple unresolved IP addresses also to check, some out of screen shot.

#### Conversations & SMTP filter
From the intitial look at the protocol hierarchy, we know that there is some SMTP traffic worth investigating. By applying a filter for smtp traffic and returning to conversations, we can out which addresses were involved with this protocol.
