# Honeypot Projects

## Cowrie-Virtual-Honeypot.md
The very first project in this Honeypot series, where I document the configuration and deployment of Cowrie, an SSH Honeypot, on a brand new EC2 instance. In this project we receive some real inbound traffic worth investigating. With this Honeypot up and running, we now have lots of room for expansion, integrating with other tools and services. 

For my university disseration, I am exploring honeypot deployments and how they can affect attacker behavioral depth. Stay tuned for imminent follow up projects as i begin the trial-phase of my implementation.
