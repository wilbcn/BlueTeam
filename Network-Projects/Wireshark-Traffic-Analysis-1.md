# 📡 Wireshark Investigation 1: First Malware PCAP Analysis!

This project is part of my on going Wireshark series, where I gain hands-on experience investigating real-world malware PCAPs using industry standard network analysis tools. Each project serves as an opportunity to sharpen my practical skills in dissecting malicious traffic, constructing a detailed timeline of events, and an executive summary to simulate the type of reporting expected from a SOC analyst.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice navigating and using Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Investigate the malware pcap to collect the key indicators of compromise
- Construct a timeline of events
- Write an executive summary
- Leverage malware analysis and sandbox tools
