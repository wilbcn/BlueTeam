# üì° Wireshark Project 3: Network Analysis & Incident report writing

This follow-up Wireshark project dives into another real-world malware PCAP. This time focusing on writing an incident report based on malicious network activity from the pcap and from the alerts.

The incident report will contains the following 3 sections:

- Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
- Victim Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the activity.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.

This PCAP is part of a series of traffic analysis exercises, found in the **Tools & Resources** section.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyse the Malware Sample PCAP provided, listed in the tools & resources
- Carry out a detailed incident report, outlined above.
- State any lessons learned and room for future growth.

### üîç Early Observations

- **`modandcrackedapk.com`**  
  - Most data exchanged (~11MB)
  - Multiple `HTTPS` TCP streams  
  - High return packet count  
  - **Strong candidate as initial download source**

- **`classicgrand.com`**  
  - Second-highest byte count  
  - Encrypted traffic via HTTPS

- **`e11271.dscg.akamaiedge.net`**  
  - Akamai CDN; could be legitimate or abused for payload delivery

- **`nemotoes-dc.nemotoads.health`**  
  - Internal host communication  
  - SMB (`microsoft-ds`) and DNS (UDP port 53)
