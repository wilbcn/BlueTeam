# ðŸ”Ž Datadog: Intro to a new SIEM tool!

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project is an expansion on my hands-on SIEM series. In previous projects I have focused primarily on Splunk, leveraging its capabilities for investigative work on attacker datasets, and practice creating alerts / dashboards in a SOC-style mindset. In this project, I pivot to Datadog, a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform. I explore Datadogs UI as a whole, while focusing on Datadog's Cloud SIEM tool which is a solution built on top of Datadog's log management platform, designed to detect threats in cloud-scale environments. With this project I am expanding my skillset, familiarising myself with security standard tools outside of Splunk, showcasing my proactiveness and adaptability to other platforms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Configure and launch a fresh EC2 instance running Windows
- Configure the Datadog Agent on this new virtual machine to ingest windows security logs
- Configure the `Windows Event Logs` content pack for Cloud SIEM
- Simulate a security event and handle the alert in Datadog
