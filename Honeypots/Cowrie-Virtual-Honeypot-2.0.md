# Cowrie-Based Honeypot Deployment on AWS 2.0

## ðŸ“š Overview
This follow up project is an adaptation and refinement of my original Cowrie honeypot deployment, found here: [link](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/edit/main/Honeypots/Cowrie-Virtual-Honeypot.md). This project serves as both a trial phase towards my research project proposal on honeypot realism and fingerprinting (University project), as well as a continuation of hands-on experience that covers multiple security domains like OS hardening and network security.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Deploy a secure SSH honeypot in AWS (secure admin access)
- Simulate a vulnerable SSH service to attract real-world attacks
- Log attacker behavior and extract useful insights
- Allow brute force attempts after a defined number - Edit the config file
- Lay the foundation for the next trial phase, of Splunk integration for log aggregation and analysis
- Begin the trial phase of my ssh honeypot research in cowrie

## ðŸ“¦ 1. â€“ Cloud Setup
In this follow up project, I create a brand new ec2 instance with similar configurations as the original deployment. 

- Public IP redacted for security reasons

### 1.1 - Honeypot Overview
Once inside my AWS account, I navigated to EC2 and selected launch instance. I named it `Cowrie-Trial-01`, and selected `Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS`.

With the AMI successfully selected, I then chose our instance type `t3.medium`. I aim to deploy two contrasting honeypots for a comparative analysis, and therefore predict that this instance type will be a cost effective yet appropriate solution for my project.

I then created a new key pair for secure admin access. We use SSH keys to access the system securely, while cowrie as a honeypot simulates password logins for the attacker. Attackers interact with Cowries fake shell, not the real system.

I then created a brand new VPC and subnet in `eu-north-1a` (not shown), and enabled auto-assign public IP.

Next, I needed a new Security Group to allow remote Admin access. For this deployment, I allowed inbound SSH connections from my IP only on port 22 and port 22222. However later this will be changed so that admin logons are only accessible on port 22222, and public access over port 22.

For storage, I chose `30 GB of EBS General Purpose (SSD)`

### 2. - Honeypot Installation
To connect to the brand new EC2 instance, I used `MobaXTerm`, a free SSH client. The first step taken was to restrict the .pem permissions via ssh terminal.

```
chmod 400 cowrie-trial-01.pem
ls -l
total 8
-r--------@ 1 user  staff  1674 20 May 17:09 cowrie-trial-01.pem
```

On the SSH client, I then successfully logged into the ec2 instance for the first time. To begin with, I ran some commands to refresh the systemâ€™s package list and apply the latest updates. The following segment mirrors the steps taken in the original deployment linked at the top of this project.

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade
```

Next, I installed system-wide support for Python virtual environments and other dependencies, as per the Cowrie guide.

```
sudo apt-get install git python3-venv libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential libpython3-dev python3-minimal authbind
```

To continue with the Cowrie setup, I created a dedicated user account on the system. Creating a dedicated non-root user helps limits the potential damage an attacker could do if they manage to escape or exploit the honeypotâ€”following the principle of least privilege for better security and containment.

```
ubuntu@my-ip-address:~$ sudo adduser --disabled-password cowrie
info: Adding user `cowrie' ...

info: Adding user `cowrie' to group `users' ...
ubuntu@my-ip-address:~$ sudo su - cowrie
cowrie@my-ip-address:~$
```

Then I ran the below command to clone the Cowrie source code, and moved to the Cowrie directory.

```
cowrie@my-ip-address:~$ git clone http://github.com/cowrie/cowrie
Cloning into 'cowrie'...

cowrie@my-ip-address:~$ cd cowrie
cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$
```

Now I needed to setup a virtual environment, which is an isolated Python environment that prevents package conflicts and also keeps Cowrieâ€™s dependencies separate from the rest of the system.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fa34e53-9e82-4e45-9aba-b03ca3a22545)

```
cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$ python3 -m venv cowrie-env
cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$ source cowrie-env/bin/activate
(cowrie-env) cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
(cowrie-env) cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

The Cowrie configuration file is stored in `cowrie.cfg.dist` and `cowrie.cfg` (Located in `cowrie/etc`).

```
(cowrie-env) cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie/etc$ ls -l
total 44
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cowrie cowrie 37839 Apr  9 18:44 cowrie.cfg.dist
```

`cowrie.cfg` is our custom config file. The guide states: Both files are read on startup, where entries from `cowrie.cfg` take precedence. The `.dist` file can be overwritten by upgrades, `cowrie.cfg `will not be touched. To run with a standard configuration, there is no need to change anything. 

For now, I copied the `.dist` file to `cowrie.cfg`, which gives us a starting point for customisation later on if we would like to.

```
(cowrie-env) cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie/etc$ cp cowrie.cfg.dist cowrie.cfg
(cowrie-env) cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie/etc$ ls -l
total 84
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cowrie cowrie 37839 Apr  9 19:03 cowrie.cfg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cowrie cowrie 37839 Apr  9 18:44 cowrie.cfg.dist
```

With that last step finished, I can now start Cowrie (As a non-root user `cowrie`).

```
cowrie@my-ip-address:~/cowrie$ bin/cowrie start
```

In the below code, I confirmed that Cowrie is listening on port `2222`. I then went back to AWS and finished the Security Group rule to allow attackers access to our Honeypot. Port 22 is also open, however our Security Group rule allows only SSH access from my IP only.

```
sudo apt install net-tools

ubuntu@my-ip-address:~$ sudo netstat -tulnp | grep LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2222            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14348/python3
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1/systemd
```

```

```

Cowrie is now configured and running on port 2222 (default) and ready to accept SSH connections. 

### 3. - Swapping ports
By default Cowrie will run on port 2222/2223. To run the honeypot on port 22, I need to move the real SSH service to a new port. To avoid lock-outs during this trial phase, I will leave Admin access open on port 22 until non-standard port 22222 is correctly working for Admin access.
