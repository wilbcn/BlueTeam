# ðŸ“¡ Wireshark Project 4: 

## Overview
Another Wireshark hands-on lab, investigating a malware pcap called "Big Fish in a Little Pong". This investigation was carried out on my own virtual homelab, created on VirtualBox, with a Kali linux distro. 

## Goals
- Executive Summary: State in simple terms what happened (who, what, when)
- Victim Details: Correlate and share the details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name etc)
- Indentify the IOC's: IP addresses, domains, and urls, associated with the attacker activity. Hashes of any malware from the pcap.
- Apply a logical analysis to the PCAP, leveraring the knowledge I have gained from independant study (Blue Team Level 1), and TryHackMe CTF style Labs.
- Prepare myself for the BTL1 exam, and gain experience with report writing during investigations.
