# üõ°Ô∏è Blue Team Projects

This repository is a collection of Blue Team‚Äìfocused projects I've completed to deepen my understanding of defensive cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques. These projects are hands-on and practical, based on interactive labs, exercises, and CTFs, from platforms like **TryHackMe** and the **Blue Team Level 1** training path.

Each project is designed to strengthen specific areas of Blue Team knowledge ‚Äî from network traffic analysis and threat detection, to incident response and log investigation.
