# üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft XDR: Attack Surface Reduction

## üìò Overview
Another hands-on practical project, this time focusing on Defender for Endpoint. The goal of this project is to create and test Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules that harden Windows endpoints against common malware, hishing, and attacker exploitation techniques. ASR is a Defender for Endpoint feature, managed via Intune or other tools. These projects serve as a learning resource for myself, whilst also demonstrating my on-going learning into industry standard cybersecurity tools. 

## üéØ Project Objectives


## Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Summary
An attack surface includes all the places in which an attacker could comprimise the organisations devices (endpoints) or networks. Reducing the attack surface means we are giving attackers fewer ways to perform their attacks, targeting software behaviours such as:
- Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files
- Running obfuscated / suspicious scripts
- Suspicious app behaviours

These software behaviours are sometimes seen in legitimate applications, however in this case they are risky as attackers commonly abuse them through malware. ASR rules cna help minimise this risk and help keep the organisation safe. [Resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction)
