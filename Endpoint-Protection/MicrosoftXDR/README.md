# Endpoint security with Microsoft XDR

Projects found in this folder showcase exploring the Microsoft XDR platform, where I carry out fundamental projects to help solidy existing knowledge and gain further experience using the XDR UI. I explore various areas of XDR, including Security, Purview, Entra, Email & Collaboration, and more.

## Data-Loss-Prevention-Practice
In this beginner project, I get familiar with Microsoft Purview and Data Loss Prevention capabilities (DLP). I created 3 policies for the organisation, including:
- PII Detection & External Sharing Block: Detect and restrict external sharing of PII such as passport numbers
- Keyword Leakage: Prevent files with sensitive business tags from being shared externally (e.g, "Confidential", "Internal Use Only")
- File type-based policy: Detect and block specific file types from being shared externally (e.g., .zip, .exe)

## Email-Collaboration-Threat-Protection
In this follow up project, I explore Email & Collaboration threat protection domain as part of Microsoft Defender for Office 365. I configured threat policies and test them against my test users, as well as carrying out simulated phishing campgains. This project served as fundamental yet practical hands on experience with these tools. In this project I created:
- Anti-phishing policy: User Impersonation Protection
- Anti-malware policy: Detect and investigate a test malware file
- Attack Simulation Training (AST): Simulate real-world phishing and social engineering attacks
