# Cowrie-Based Honeypot Deployment on AWS 2.0

## ðŸ“š Overview
This follow up project is an adaptation and refinement of my original Cowrie honeypot deployment, found here: [link](https://github.com/wilbcn/BlueTeam/edit/main/Honeypots/Cowrie-Virtual-Honeypot.md). This project serves as both a trial phase towards my research project proposal on honeypot realism and fingerprinting (University project), as well as a continuation of hands-on experience that covers multiple security domains like OS hardening and network security.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Deploy a secure SSH honeypot in AWS (secure admin access)
- Simulate a vulnerable SSH service to attract real-world attacks
- Log attacker behavior and extract useful insights
- Configure the EC2 instance with the `CIS Hardened Image Level 1 on Ubuntu Linux Server 24.04 LTS`
- Lay the foundation for the next trial phase, of Splunk integration for log aggregation and analysis
